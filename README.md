# Microsoft Office SmartArt Graphic Templates

## Usage
1. Download `*.glox` files from [release](https://github.com/BrandonStudio/SmartArtTemplates/releases/latest).
2. Put downloaded files to `%UserProfile%\Microsoft\Templates\SmartArt Graphics`.
3. Enjoy.

Alternatively, you can download `01-glox-all.zip` and extract all files to that folder.

### Note
If you can't use glox files (e.g., you use macOS), you can still download corresponding pptx files and copy diagrams in it.

Again, you can download `02-pptx-all.zip` to get all.

## License
Currently, all template files are extracted from Designer, and the `uniqueId`s starts with `microsoft.com`. So I think it is OK to use as long as you have a license for Microsoft Office.
