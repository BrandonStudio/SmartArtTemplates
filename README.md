# Microsoft Office SmartArt Graphic Templates

## Usage
1. Download `*.glox` files from [release](https://github.com/BrandonStudio/SmartArtTemplates/releases/latest).
2. Put downloaded files to `%UserProfile%\Microsoft\Templates\SmartArt Graphics`.
3. Enjoy.

## License
Currently, all template files are extracted from Designer, and the `uniqueId`s starts with `microsoft.com`. So I think it is OK to use as long as you have a license for Microsoft Office.
